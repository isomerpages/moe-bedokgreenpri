School Canteen
==============

The school environment plays an important role in nurturing and sustaining good eating habits.&nbsp;We strongly encourage students to consume a meal before snacking. The school canteen serves a healthy plate consisting of wholemeal noodles or brown rice with meat, vegetables and fruits. Here in BGPS, we ensure that there are a variety of stalls which help nurture and sustain good eating habits in all our students.
