Welcome to our Bedok Green Primary School website. Nestled right in the heart of the Bedok neighbourhood, Bedok Green Primary School is a perfect reflection of the microcosm of what Singapore society is all about – a very good mix of students of all races, cultures, demographics and family backgrounds. Located on the ‘equator’ between the north and south of Bedok along New Upper Changi Road, our school is easily accessible by both Bedok and Tanah Merah MRT stations, as well as bus stops that are fully connected by sheltered walkways. As such, many of our students come from the beautiful estates in the surrounding areas, from the nearby Bedok HDB blocks, the East Coast, Siglap and Frankel regions in the south, as well as the Fengshan and Chai Chee regions in the north. With our distinctive school programmes, strategically-designed curriculum, passionate and caring teachers, allied educators and non-teaching staff, modern infrastructure and well-equipped and facilities, parents and stakeholders often compliment the school for truly embodying the tenet of ‘Every School, A Good School’.

As Principal, I am pleased to continue with the good work that my predecessors Mr Lee Yin Hin (2002 – 2008), Mrs Sita Singh (2009 – 2015), and Mrs Celine Ng Kim Choo (2016 – 2019) had done to build our school from strength to strength over the past two decades. The end of 2024 culminated with the first full year of implementation of our new Total Curriculum Framework, amongst which included several firsts – our very first Overseas Learning Experience (OLE) trip to Nagoya, Japan, for student leaders; our very first Student Development Day that focused on developing students’ Growth Mindset; a revised Children’s Day programme that focused on providing varied learning experiences ranging from a movie experience to a day out at an indoor playground, to a learn-a-sport programme; our very first Lee Kuan Yew All Round Excellence Awardee in Matthew Loi Hao Zhe – our 2023 President of the Student Council, and our very first Singapore Silent Hero Awardee in Ansh Kejriwal, who is our incoming 2025 President of the Student Council. With greater clarity in our Total Curriculum Framework spelling out the strategies and alignment of the myriad of school programmes that seek to develop specific emerging 21st Century Competencies, we are well-placed to continue in our school’s journey of excellence as we fulfil our vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character.

I have shared with my colleagues that 2025 will continue to focus on the implementation of our Total Curriculum Framework. This will include the reinforcement of the five school values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Compassion in tandem with our Character and Citizenship Education focus on the 7 Habits and The Leader In Me. Our Applied Learning Programme in Environmental Education (E2@BGPS) and Learning for Life Programme in Sports and aesthetics To ReInforce Values Education (STRIVE) will continue to be strengthened to deepen students’ awareness of environmental issues as well as develop their talents in sports and aesthetics. We will be organizing two more overseas trips in 2025 as part of our OLE programme to strengthen students’ civic, global and cross-cultural literacies, and our student leadership programme will continue to break new ground in empowering students to take greater ownership as they lead and to give them a voice. As mentioned earlier, Ansh Kejriwal attained the Singapore Silent Hero Award, and the reason for his attainment of this award was because of the initiative he demonstrated in identifying common problems his peers faced, and devised a unique solution on his own to alleviate their woes, primarily because he was empowered to problem solve with some teachers’ guidance. I hope that through the structured implementation of our Total Curriculum Framework over the next few years, we will be able to empower BGPians to develop strong confidence in themselves and take greater ownership for their learning and leadership.

I am delighted to congratulate all our recently-graduated 2024 BGPians for sustaining our excellent PSLE results. While academic excellence is important, holistic development beyond the academics is even more so. We have introduced the pinnacle student awards since 2020 to recognize students not only in academic excellence, but in sports excellence, aesthetics excellence, leadership excellence, and most importantly, character and citizenship excellence, to whom the BGPian of the Year will be awarded. I am especially proud of our outgoing President of the Student Council, Gan Xuan Ee (6 Integrity/2024) for being the winner of the 2024 BGPian of the Year Award, which represents the epitome of what we desire for all BGPians to be – embracing and demonstrating a balanced and holistic approach towards education, being an empowered leader in his field, constantly guiding and inspiring others towards achieving excellence, and using his talents to serve the school and community. Xuan Ee was also featured in the media for his all-round excellence as a BGPian and you can find out more about his BGPS learning experiences [undefined](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20241120-5376148)here. The story of our previous BGPian of the Year, Matthew Loi Hao Zhe (6 Respect/2023), also featured in the media, can be found [undefined](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20231122-1451759)here. In addition, I wish to congratulate the following students for attaining the other pinnacle student awards: Lee Yu Ze (6 Integrity/2024) and Goh Bo Xuan Arthur (6 Responsibility/2024) for Sports Excellence, Sun Mankai (6 Integrity/2024) and Nur Qairina Bte Muhamed Nizam (6 Responsibility/2024) for Aesthetics Excellence, Jamie New Xin Ying (6 Integrity/2024) and Dhanya Shree Sivakumar (6 Integrity/2024) for Leadership Excellence, and Muhammad Alfyan Bin Muhammad Tarmimi (6 Compassion/2024) for the Warrior Award, for being an inspiration to the BGPS community by demonstrating remarkable perseverance and resilience, and overcoming difficult circumstances and personal challenges to do well. Zheng Yatong (6 Integrity/2024) was also the winner of the Malathi Das Bilingual Award for excelling in both the English and Mother Tongue Languages.

All these sterling achievements attest not only to the splendid efforts and hard work of our students, but more importantly, the strong support and guidance given by all our staff, and the splendid school-home partnership with our BGPian parents. My desire is for success to breed success, and that even when the chips are down and the challenges are high, our students will remain resilient in the fight to overcome difficulties, with the school and home playing a critical role in cheering them on along the journey.

In conclusion, my staff and I look forward to working with you and your child in the new school year. We extend our warmest welcome to all students for an exciting time of learning and growth, and specially embrace with open arms all new students who have chosen to make Bedok Green Primary School their second home. For our new Primary Ones, my&nbsp;staff have specially planned a three-day&nbsp;orientation programme&nbsp;to help them&nbsp;set goals and&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;school routines and expectations. I am sure that they will find the orientation beneficial as they make new friends and discover that Bedok Green staff are caring and nurturing. Should you have any feedback to help us improve in our processes or affirm our practices, you may also write to us at&nbsp;[bgps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:bgps@moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;or call us at 64425416.&nbsp;Looking forward to an even more exciting and empowering 2025 adventure ahead as we persevere and succeed!
