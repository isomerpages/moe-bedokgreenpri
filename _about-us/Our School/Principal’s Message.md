<p>Welcome to our Bedok Green Primary School website. Nestled right in the
heart of the Bedok neighbourhood, Bedok Green Primary School is a perfect
reflection of the microcosm of what Singapore society is all about – a
very good mix of students of all races, cultures, demographics and family
backgrounds. Located on the ‘equator’ between the north and south of Bedok
along New Upper Changi Road, our school is easily accessible by both Bedok
and Tanah Merah MRT stations, as well as bus stops that are fully connected
by sheltered walkways. As such, many of our BGPians come from the beautiful
estates in the surrounding areas, from the nearby Bedok HDB blocks, the
East Coast, Siglap and Frankel regions in the south, as well as the Fengshan
and Chai Chee regions in the north. With our distinctive school programmes,
strategically designed curriculum, passionate and caring teachers, allied
educators and non-teaching staff, modern infrastructure and well-equipped
and facilities, parents and stakeholders often compliment the school for
truly embodying the tenet of ‘Every School, A Good School’.</p>
<p>As Principal, I am pleased to continue with the good work that my predecessors
Mr Lee Yin Hin (2002 – 2008), Mrs Sita Singh (2009 – 2015), and Mrs Celine
Ng Kim Choo (2016 – 2019) had done to build our school from strength to
strength over the past two decades. 2026 will be a significant one for
BGPS as we will be celebrating our school’s 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary,
culminating with our milestone celebration on Friday, 29 May 2026, for
BGPians, staff, alumni, parents and school partners. Indeed, there is much
to be grateful for in the past 25 years of BGPS’ existence and evolution,
from its infancy when the school’s foundations had to be re-established
after merger between Bedok View Primary School and Bedok South Primary
school, to our current reputation of being a school that brings out every
child’s personal best. BGPS has come a long way since then, having implemented
our very own Total Curriculum Framework over the last few years to meet
the diverse needs of our BGPians, through the provision of a wide array
of programmes that seeks to stretch BGPians and fulfil their potential.
This includes our signature Applied Learning Programme in Environmental
Education (E2@BGPS) and Learning for Life Programme in Sports and aesthetics
To ReInforce Values Education (STRIVE), which will see further iterations
in its curriculum to strengthen the development of emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (e21CC) like critical, adaptive and inventive thinking as
well as collaborative skills, which are vital for BGPians to thrive in
the real world. Our Student Leadership Programme will also continue to
be strengthened through the 7 Habits and The Leader in Me curriculum to
deepen BGPians’ leadership and problem-solving abilities, confidence, and
to be advocates for civic issues that resonate strongly with them. Our
Overseas Learning Experience (OLE) Programme has also been established
with partner schools in Mihama Town (Japan), Chengdu and Hong Kong (China),
as well as Nantou (Taiwan), and we will be looking forward to reinforcing
cross-cultural and global literacies amongst BGPians through the provision
of such rich student-exchange opportunities. Finally, our High Ability
Learners’ Programme will be strengthened, be it in English Debate training,
Chinese Language Reporter Programme, E2K Mathematics and E2K Science with
Mathematics &amp; Science Olympiad training programmes, Green Makers Programme,
and Artist In School Scheme. Rounded up by our standardized MOE core learning
subjects and our wide array of CCAs across sports, performing arts, uniformed
groups and clubs, our Total Curriculum has proven to be effective in leading
BGPians towards our school vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength
and Character, with inculcation of the five school values of Integrity,
Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Compassion as a base.</p>
<p>We have witnessed how our curriculum has started to bear fruit through
tangible student outcomes recently – our very first Lee Kuan Yew All Round
Excellence Awardee in Matthew Loi Hao Zhe – our 2023 President of the Student
Council, our very first Singapore Silent Hero Awardee in Ansh Kejriwal,
who was our 2025 President of the Student Council, as well as our second
Singapore Silent Hero Awardee in Cayen Lee Ruizhe (4 Compassion/2025).
I am also delighted to congratulate all our recently-graduated 2025 BGPians
for sustaining our excellent PSLE results. While academic excellence is
important, holistic development beyond the academics is even more so. We
have introduced the pinnacle BGPian awards since 2020 to recognize BGPians
not only in academic excellence, but in sports excellence, aesthetics excellence,
leadership excellence, and most importantly, character and citizenship
excellence, to whom the BGPian of the Year will be awarded. I am especially
proud of our outgoing Vice-President of the Student Council, Lim Yee Jie
(6 Integrity/2025) for being the winner of the 2025 BGPian of the Year
Award, which represents the epitome of what we desire for all BGPians to
be – embracing and demonstrating a balanced and holistic approach towards
education, being an empowered leader in his field, constantly guiding and
inspiring others towards achieving excellence, and using his talents to
serve the school and community. In addition, I wish to congratulate the
following BGPians for attaining the other pinnacle awards: Ryan Tan Wei
Zher &nbsp;(6 Integrity/2025) for Sports Excellence, Chen Ruoqi (6 Integrity/2025),
Sharifah Sorfinah Binte Syed Muhamad Faizal (6 Compassion/2025) and Yvonne
Chen Yan Xi (6 Responsibility/2025) for Aesthetics Excellence, Ansh Kejriwat
(6 Integrity/2025) for Leadership Excellence, and Ong Ming Kai (6 Respect/2025),
Poh Lu Eng (6 Bravery) and Azaan Khan Bin Mohamed Rafi Khan (6 Respect/2025)
for the Warrior Award, for being inspirations to the BGPS community by
demonstrating remarkable perseverance and resilience, and overcoming difficult
circumstances and personal challenges to do well. Azaan was featured in
the media for his resilience and ability to persevere in the midst of challenges,
and his heartwarming story can be found <a href="https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/psle-leukemia-cancer-exam-boy-student-chemotherapy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.beritaharian.sg/singapura/leukemia-tidak-halang-pelajar-raih-keputusan-baik-psle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>together with media stories <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20241120-5376148" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20231122-1451759" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>of our previous BGPians of the Year, Gan Xuan Ee and Matthew Loi
respectively. Ong Zee Xuan (6 Respect/2025) was also the winner of the
Malathi Das Bilingual Award for excelling in both the English and Mother
Tongue Languages.</p>
<p>All these sterling outcomes and achievements attest not only to the splendid
efforts and hard work of our students, but equally significantly, the strong
support, dedication and guidance given by all our staff, and the committed
school-home partnership with our BGPian parents. My wish is for success
to breed success, and that even when the chips are down and the challenges
are high, our BGPians will remain steadfast and resilient in the fight
to overcome difficulties, with the school and home playing a critical role
in cheering them on along the journey.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my staff and I look forward to working with you and your
child in the new school year. We extend our warmest welcome to all BGPians
for an exciting time of learning and growth, and specially embrace with
open arms all new BGPians who have chosen to make Bedok Green Primary School
their second home. For our new Primary Ones, my&nbsp;staff have specially
planned a four-day&nbsp;orientation programme&nbsp;to help them&nbsp;set
goals and&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;school routines and expectations. I am sure
that they will find the orientation beneficial as they make new friends
and discover that Bedok Green staff are caring and nurturing. Should you
have any feedback to help us improve in our processes or affirm our practices,
you may also write to us at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bgps@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;or

empowering 2026 adventure ahead as we seek to embody our school motto,
Persevere and Succeed!</p>
