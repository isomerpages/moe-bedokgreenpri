Welcome to our Bedok Green Primary School website. As I enter 2023 in my fourth year as Principal of Bedok Green Primary School, I am pleased to continue with the good work that my predecessors Mr Lee Yin Hin (2002 – 2008), Mrs Sita Singh (2009 – 2015), and Mrs Celine Ng Kim Choo (2016 – 2019) had done to build our school from strength to strength over the past 21 years. In the last three years, even as Singapore rode the storms of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am grateful that our students and staff have similarly overcome the challenges posed by the numerous Safe Management Measures (SMMs) we have had to go through, eventually emerging more confident and competent as we navigated the educational landscape by adapting nimbly to new and relevant e-pedagogies, blended learning, differentiated instruction and adjustments to new modes of holistic assessment. Staff professionalism, student tenacity and the emphasis on upholding our five school values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Compassion have been core tenets of this transformation, and we will continue to strive in our quest to develop all students in attaining our school vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character.

With the lifting of most SMMs over the last few months of 2022, we have worked doubly hard to bring back many physical programmes and activities for students to experience some pre-COVID normalcy, but we are also mindful of not losing the new gains that we have obtained as a result of the learning from COVID. Overnight outdoor camps, external learning journeys, swimming programmes and mass celebrations have resumed, albeit with new adaptations where possible. Parent Teacher Meetings and Conferences have also been modified to include virtual meetings to accommodate busy parents, while physical meetings are scheduled when face-to-face ones are needed. I believe that this blend of mixing what we have learnt over the last three years together with the best of what existed pre-COVID will serve us well over the next few years as we all learn together to adapt to a new normal to bring out the best in our students and staff.

As we look ahead to a new school year in 2023, our school’s directions will focus on six key areas. First, we will sustain what we have started over the last two years for **The Leader in Me** and **7 Habits** in Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) while raising the quality of our **Student Leadership** programme. Second, we will enhance **Environmental Education @ BGPS** to deepen students’ experiences, including tapping on our new Makerspace, The Imaginarium, as well as our award-winning Community Garden. Third, we will enhance **Sports and aesthetics To ReInforce Values Education (STRIVE)** by tapping on our current platforms in CCAs, CCE, PE, Art and Music. Fourth, we will procced with the next phase of our **Enhanced School Resourcing** plans as an MOE UPLIFT Phase One school. Fifth, we will endeavour to strengthen staff professional development in **Blended Learning &amp;** **Differentiated Instruction** and build staff mindset towards empowerment and optimism. Finally, we will enhance our school’s Holistic Development Assessment plan, including our revised Conduct Grade measurement instruments to provide sharper feedback for students to learn and grow.

With regard to Holistic Development Assessment, we have introduced the pinnacle student awards since 2020 to recognize students not only in academic excellence, but in sports excellence, aesthetics excellence, leadership excellence, and most importantly, character and citizenship excellence, to whom the BGPian of the Year will be awarded. I am delighted to announce that Cheryl Hwang Qin Ling (6 Integrity/2022) is the winner of the 2022 BGPian of the Year Award, which represents the epitome of what we desire for all BGPians to be – embracing and demonstrating a balanced and holistic approach towards education, being an empowered leader in her field, constantly guiding and inspiring others towards achieving excellence, and using her talents to serve the school and community. I also wish to congratulate the following students for attaining the following pinnacle student awards: Syed Hanz Naufal Bin Syed Nabil (6 Resilience/2022) and Ampo Ayesha Phoebe Centeno (6 Respect/2022) for Sports Excellence, Muhammad Hadhari Bin Saiful Bahri (6 Responsibility/2022) and Nur Illyana Binte Syed Nabil (6 Respect/2022) for Aesthetics Excellence, Jaylene Lee Ming Huey (6 Respect/2022) for Leadership Excellence, and Siti Umairah Binte Abdullah (6 Responsibility/2022) for the Warrior Award, for being an inspiration to the BGPS community by demonstrating remarkable perseverance and resilience, and overcoming difficult circumstances and challenges to do well.

In conclusion, my staff and I look forward to working with you and your child in the new school year. We extend our warmest welcome to all students for an exciting time of learning and growth, and specially embrace with open arms all new students who have chosen to make Bedok Green Primary School their second home. For our new Primary Ones, my&nbsp;staff have specially planned a three-day&nbsp;orientation programme&nbsp;to help them&nbsp;set goals and&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;school routines and expectations. I am sure that they will find the orientation beneficial as they make new friends and discover that Bedok Green staff are caring and nurturing. Should you have any feedback to help us improve in our processes or affirm our practices, you may also write to us at [bgps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:bgps@moe.edu.sg) or call us at 64425416.&nbsp;Looking forward to an even more exciting and empowering 2023 adventure ahead as we persevere and succeed!

Mr Benjamin Yong<br>
Principal
