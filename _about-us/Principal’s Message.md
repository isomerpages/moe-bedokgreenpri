Welcome to our Bedok Green Primary School website. As the current Principal of Bedok Green Primary School since 2020, I am humbled at the good work that my predecessors Mr Lee Yin Hin (2002 – 2008), Mrs Sita Singh (2009 – 2015), and Mrs Celine Ng Kim Choo (2016 – 2019) had done to grow our school from strength to strength, and am pleased to continue the transformative work that had begun over the past 20 years. Even as we commemorated our school’s 20th Anniversary on 9 July 2021 in the midst of the pandemic, our celebrations were a reflection of the importance of holistic education, and more significantly, the reinforcement of our school values, especially that of resilience – to be able to persevere no matter what the circumstances may be, and to always be grateful for our past even as we are empowered for our future. In relation to this, I wish to extend my gratitude not only to our past Principals, but also to our past and present staff who had played a part in contributing to the development and growth of Bedok Green Primary School. In our reflections and reconnections with staff and students past and present, we believe that Bedok Green Primary School has left an indelible mark on those who had gone through our gates, and we know that we must never rest on our laurels even as we continue to build better and remain true to our school philosophy of being a school where Every Child Matters.

  

Our school philosophy has never been held more strongly than in the past two pandemic years that we had experienced in 2020 and 2021. With increasing awareness of mental health issues and the loss of social activities that have curtailed human interactions, we recognized that we needed to work more strategically to ensure that no child was left behind and that learning could continue to take place effectively without compromise. This was most evident in the good PSLE results that we had sustained in comparison with previous years, but beyond our academic achievements, we have continued to forge our own path in the region by having well-established school programmes and more crucially, a cohesive staff who will spare no effort to ensure that every child is cared for. As we move nimbly into 2022 and navigate our way with established procedures to ensure safe management measures in school, we are heartened, excited and driven to be even more innovative in our teaching and learning processes, to fulfil our school vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character.

  

After two years of school re-envisioning, big as well as small-group discussions with staff and stakeholders, we have established, implemented and reviewed the first year of our three-year strategic plan that spells the approach to fulfilling our vision. Differentiated instruction for engaged learning will continue to be a key area of focus to ensure that every child’s learning needs can be met. We will also emphasise the importance of leadership, character and citizenship education with the second phase of our school-wide Leader in Me programme and supported by the development of habits to empower learning. All these will be upheld through the provision of a caring and supportive learning environment to ensure students’ well-being and nurture students’ strengths and interests, so that they will be empowered to learn and to succeed. In 2022, we will also be strengthening our school’s Applied Learning Programme, Environmental Education@BGPS (E2@BGPS), and our Learning for Life Programme, Sports and aesthetics To ReInforce Values Education (STRIVE). With the official opening of our new Makerspace, The Imaginarium, on 9 July 2021, we hope that students’ interest in green issues like global warming and climate change will be aroused even as we learn to be more innovative in our recycling efforts to save the earth and contribute to the green economy as outlined by Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s recent unveiling of the Skills Demand for the Future Economy Report, of which the cluster of skills needed for the green sector will be critical for the students of today.

  

Our school theme, ‘EMPOWER@BGPS’, stands for Equipping My Pupils to take OWnership and Embrace Resilience’. It seeks to be a rallying cry for all students to have greater autonomy and independence to discover their strengths and interests so that they will develop a passion for learning while inculcating a spirit of resilience in every aspect of daily school life. It is our desire that every child who passes through the gates of Bedok Green continues to develop holistically – cognitively, physically, aesthetically, socially and with sound, moral values. To emphasize this, all our classes will continue to be named after the values that we hold dear – Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Compassion, Bravery, Graciousness, Perseverance, and Synergy. We have also introduced the pinnacle student awards since 2020 to recognize students not only in academic excellence, but in sports excellence, aesthetics excellence, leadership excellence, and most importantly, character and citizenship excellence, to whom the BGPian of the Year will be awarded. In 2021, we also introduced the Warrior Award to recognize students who exemplify great resilience in the course of their education in BGPS. To this, I wish to congratulate Ashlyn Yu Mei Jin (6 Resilience/ 2021) for being the first recipient of the Warrior Award, and Tang Youheng (6 Resilience/ 2021) for attaining the 2021 BGPian of the Year Award.

  

My teachers and I look forward to working with you and your child in the new school year. We warmly welcome all students for an exciting time of learning and growth, and specially embrace with open arms all new students who have chosen to make Bedok Green Primary School their second home. For our new Primary Ones, my teachers have specially planned a three-day orientation programme to help them set goals and adapt to school routines and expectations. I am sure that they will find the orientation beneficial as they make new friends and discover that Bedok Green teachers are caring and nurturing. Should you have any feedback to help us improve in our processes or affirm our practices, you may also write to us at bgps@moe.edu.sg or call us at 64425416.
