Welcome to our Bedok Green Primary School website. As I enter 2024 in my fifth year as Principal of Bedok Green Primary School, I am pleased to continue with the good work that my predecessors Mr Lee Yin Hin (2002 – 2008), Mrs Sita Singh (2009 – 2015), and Mrs Celine Ng Kim Choo (2016 – 2019) had done to build our school from strength to strength over the past two decades. The end of 2023 marks a full year of school life that resembled the pre-pandemic years, with the return to normalcy for almost all school activities while adapting to the affordances that we have introduced because of our learning experiences from the COVID years, including sharpening our Home-Based Learning functions, tapping on efficient video conferences where appropriate, and maintaining our good habits of proper hygiene practice.&nbsp;Our students and staff have emerged more confident and competent as we navigated the post-pandemic educational landscape by adapting nimbly to blended learning, differentiated instruction and adjustments to new modes of holistic assessment. Staff professionalism, student tenacity and the emphasis on upholding our five school values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Compassion have been core tenets of this transformation, and we will continue to strive in our quest to develop all students in attaining our school vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character. I am also happy to congratulate all our recently-graduated 2023 BGPians for bringing in our best PSLE results ever attained – a most sterling achievement that attests not only to the splendid efforts and hard work of our staff, but just as importantly, the strong support from our BGPian parents.

As we look ahead to a brand new school year in 2024, our school’s directions will focus on the implementation of our newly-developed Total Curriculum Framework, which is something that our staff have worked very hard to put together over the past year, with inputs from both our School Advisory Committee as well as our Parents Support Group. Our Total Curriculum Framework spells out our beliefs towards teaching and learning, and our distinctive BGPS approach in curriculum implementation to enable all learners, enrich BGPians’ learning, and empower learners to be future-ready. It will highlight the key focus areas in our BGPS curriculum, and the learning experiences we will provide to bring out the very best in every BGPian. Our recently developed Holistic Development Assessment plan is also aligned with our Total Curriculum Framework to facilitate BGPians’ understanding of the values, behaviours and conduct we expect in daily living. &nbsp;&nbsp;

With regard to Holistic Development Assessment, we have introduced the pinnacle student awards since 2020 to recognize students not only in academic excellence, but in sports excellence, aesthetics excellence, leadership excellence, and most importantly, character and citizenship excellence, to whom the BGPian of the Year will be awarded. I am tremendously pleased to congratulate Matthew Loi Hao Zhe (6 Respect/2023) for being the winner of the 2023 BGPian of the Year Award, which represents the epitome of what we desire for all BGPians to be – embracing and demonstrating a balanced and holistic approach towards education, being an empowered leader in his field, constantly guiding and inspiring others towards achieving excellence, and using his talents to serve the school and community. Matthew was also featured in the media for his all-round excellence as a BGPian and you can find out more about his BGPS learning experiences [here](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=851310986996153&amp;set=a.499451088848813). I also wish to congratulate the following students for attaining the following pinnacle student awards: Aaliah Ilyna Bte Muhd Alias (6 Responsibility/2023), Teo Swee Yin (6 Respect/2023) and Jarvis Toh Yu Yang (6 Responsibility/2023) for Sports Excellence, Guo Shiyu (6 Integrity/2023) for Aesthetics Excellence, Fong Yi Tong (6 Integrity/2023) for Leadership Excellence, and Muhammad Raimi Sabri Bin Muhammad Muzhaffar (6 Bravery/2023) for the Warrior Award, for being an inspiration to the BGPS community by demonstrating remarkable perseverance and resilience, and overcoming difficult circumstances and challenges to do well. Li Zhaoze (6 Integrity/2023) was also the winner of the Malathi Das Bilingual Award for excelling in both the English and Mother Tongue Languages.

In conclusion, my staff and I look forward to working with you and your child in the new school year. We extend our warmest welcome to all students for an exciting time of learning and growth, and specially embrace with open arms all new students who have chosen to make Bedok Green Primary School their second home. For our new Primary Ones, my&nbsp;staff have specially planned a three-day&nbsp;orientation programme&nbsp;to help them&nbsp;set goals and&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;school routines and expectations. I am sure that they will find the orientation beneficial as they make new friends and discover that Bedok Green staff are caring and nurturing. Should you have any feedback to help us improve in our processes or affirm our practices, you may also write to us at&nbsp;[bgps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:bgps@moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;or call us at 64425416.&nbsp;Looking forward to an even more exciting and empowering 2024 adventure ahead as we persevere and succeed!
