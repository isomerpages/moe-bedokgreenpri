School Song

We, in Bedok Green Primary  <br>
We always strive to do our best   

We learn and play together

And work hard as a team

Persevere and we will succeed

Strive we must for excellence

To nation give the best we can

We’re proud of school and country

We pledge our loyalty

Persevere and we will succeed

Chorus

Here we can build a future

A people with compassion and a heart

Be creative in our work and play

Together hand in hand in perfect harmony

Persevere and succeed

We believe in our dreams

Be a vibrant learning community
