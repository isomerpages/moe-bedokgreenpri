We always strive to do our best&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
We learn and play together <br>
And work hard as a team <br>
Persevere and we will succeed <br>
Strive we must for excellence <br>
To nation give the best we can <br>
Weâ€™re proud of school and country <br>
We pledge our loyalty <br>
Persevere and we will succeed <br> <br>

Here we can build a future <br>
A people with compassion and a heart <br>
Be creative in our work and play <br>
Together hand in hand in perfect harmony <br>
Persevere and succeed <br>
We believe in our dreams <br>
Be a vibrant learning community
