### 2020

**LOO Platinum Award** 

We are pleased to announce that our school has been awarded the 2020 Restroom Association of Singapore’s LOO (Let’s Observe Ourselves) Platinum Star Award! The award is given to schools for achieving the Gold Star for three consecutive years, and recognises organisations which have contributed to help Singapore achieve a world recognised standard of restroom cleanliness. We would not have achieved this award without the hard work of our P3 Restroom Ambassadors, P3 students, and most importantly, the unsung heroes who diligently work behind the scenes to keep our toilets clean – our beloved school cleaners. Our cleaners have always been essential and this award is a reminder to all of us to continue to play our part by always practising good hygiene habits and to keep our school environment clean. Special thanks goes to our teacher, Mr Martin Ho, our Year Head/Middle Primary, Mrs Margaret Teo, and Operations Manager, Mr Christopher De Silva for leading this educational effort!
