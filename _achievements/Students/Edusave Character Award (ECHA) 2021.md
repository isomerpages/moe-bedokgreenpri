ECHA for P4 to P6 Students
--------------------------

The Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to **enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions**. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports our efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.  
  

The objectives of the ECHA are:

(a)       To send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places on character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain; and  
  

(b)       To recognise outstanding students in each school who are exemplary in character, and who can be role models to inspire others.  

#### **Eligibility Criteria**

1.         Students **must be Singapore citizens.** 

2.         Students must, **on a consistent basis,** demonstrate good character and values.  Students will be identified for demonstrating the following qualities:          

> *   School values
>     
> *   A high level of civic responsibility:   
>     Students who are concerned about issues in the community or issues faced by others, initiate action to address these issues to improve the lives of others, and demonstrate commitment to make a positive difference.
>     
> *   Qualities associated with resilience**:  
>       
>     **Students who have persevered despite facing difficult circumstances (e.g. financial problems, family issues, health issues), and managed to overcome the odds and still do commendably well in academic and non-academic domains. Students may be nominated regardless of their academic results provided that their weak academic results are not due to negative character traits but attributed to difficulties that go beyond the control of the student.
