<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>Inculcate values and build social-emotional competencies with 7 habits
in our students to develop them to be good individuals and active citizens.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes / Activities:</h4>
<h5>The Leader in Me</h5>
<p>The Leader in Me (7 Habits of Highly Effective People) is used as an approach
to develop self-leadership in our students. Explicit teaching of the 7
habits are taught during level-based assembly talks and through designated
7 Habits periods for the Primary 1 and 2. For Primary 3 to Primary 6, students
learn the 7 Habits via integration in the different subjects and CCE content
areas. 7 Habits posters with developmentally appropriate descriptors are
placed in classrooms to aid students' understanding and application of
these principles.</p>
<h5>Star Awards</h5>
<p>The Star Awards are given out to deserving students who have demonstrated
the school values of Responsibility, Integrity, Resilience, Compassion
and Respect through their words and actions. Students will receive a value
collar pin and a certificate of commendation.</p>
<h5>CCE (FTGP) Lessons</h5>
<p>CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental
social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions.
The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help
strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive
peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas - Cyber
Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health,
National Education, and Sexuality Education are explored and discussed
in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons. Curriculum
time is set aside within CCE (FTGP) lessons for the four NE Commemorative
Days</p>
<p>During CCE (FTGP) lessons, time is also allocated for P3-P6 students to
plan and implement projects where they can contribute to school and community.
Through these opportunities, students learn to reflect on their experience,
put values into practice and think about how they can continue to contribute
meaningfully. Besides the level-based VIA, students are given everyday
responsibilities in the class so that they develop a sense of responsibility
and care for their own shared spaces.

<h5>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h5>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught in CCE (FTGP) at Primary
5 and 6. Students learn about physiological, social, and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to
enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Support students in managing their physiological, social
and emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students develop a moral compass and respect for
themselves and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes
about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3. The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Build positive relationships based on love and respect
(which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and
society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against
STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and
your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF BEDOK GREEN PRIMARY SCHOOL ’S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education
is delivered in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content
for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development,
Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture,
Society and Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more
information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate
topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual
messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy
ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their
growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
