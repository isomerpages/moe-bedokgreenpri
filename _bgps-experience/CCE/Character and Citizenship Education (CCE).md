<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>Inculcate values and build social-emotional competencies with 7 habits
in our students to develop them to be good individuals and active citizens.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes / Activities:</h4>
<h5>The Leader in Me</h5>
<p>The Leader in Me (7 Habits of Highly Effective People) is used as an approach
to develop self-leadership in our students. Explicit teaching of the 7
habits are taught during level-based assembly talks and through designated
7 Habits periods for the Primary 1 and 2. For Primary 3 to Primary 6, students
learn the 7 Habits via integration in the different subjects and CCE content
areas. 7 Habits posters with developmentally appropriate descriptors are
placed in classrooms to aid students' understanding and application of
these principles.</p>
<h5>Star Awards</h5>
<p>The Star Awards are given out to deserving students who have demonstrated
the school values of Responsibility, Integrity, Resilience, Compassion
and Respect through their words and actions. Students will receive a value
collar pin and a certificate of commendation.</p>
<h5>CCE (FTGP) Lessons</h5>
<p>CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental
social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions.
The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help
strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive
peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas - Cyber
Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health,
National Education, and Sexuality Education are explored and discussed
in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons. Curriculum
time is set aside within CCE (FTGP) lessons for the four NE Commemorative
Days</p>
<p>During CCE (FTGP) lessons, time is also allocated for P3-P6 students to
plan and implement projects where they can contribute to school and community.
Through these opportunities, students learn to reflect on their experience,
put values into practice and think about how they can continue to contribute
meaningfully. Besides the level-based VIA, students are given everyday
responsibilities in the class so that they develop a sense of responsibility
and care for their own shared spaces.

<h5>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h5>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught in CCE (FTGP) at Primary
5 and 6. Students learn about physiological, social, and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1.Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.The&nbsp;<strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;of Sexuality Education are:
<br>(i)&nbsp;To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions
through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;
<br>(ii)To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;<u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of
self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours,
development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication,
problem-solving and decision-making skills; and
<br>(iii)To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves
and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit
of society, through the inculcation of&nbsp;<u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u>&nbsp;about
sexuality.</p>
<p>3.The&nbsp;<strong>Key Messages</strong>&nbsp;of Sexuality Education are:
<br>(i) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
<br>(ii)Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);
<br>(iii)Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and
<br>(iv)Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Bedok Green Primary School’s Sexuality Education Programme for 2024</strong>
<br>4.&nbsp;Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through

in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science
<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong>:
<br>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages
in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite
sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.&nbsp;</p>
