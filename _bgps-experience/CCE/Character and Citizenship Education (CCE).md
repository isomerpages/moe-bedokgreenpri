<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>Inculcate values and build social-emotional competencies with 7 habits
in our students to develop them to be good individuals and active citizens.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes / Activities:</h4>
<h5>The Leader in Me</h5>
<p>The Leader in Me (7 Habits of Highly Effective People) is used as an approach
to develop self-leadership in our students. Explicit teaching of the 7
habits are taught during level-based assembly talks and through designated
7 Habits periods for the Primary 1 and 2. For Primary 3 to Primary 6, students
learn the 7 Habits via integration in the different subjects and CCE content
areas. 7 Habits posters with developmentally appropriate descriptors are
placed in classrooms to aid students' understanding and application of
these principles.</p>
<h5>Star Awards</h5>
<p>The Star Awards are given out to deserving students who have demonstrated
the school values of Responsibility, Integrity, Resilience, Compassion
and Respect through their words and actions. Students will receive a value
collar pin and a certificate of commendation.</p>
<h5>CCE (FTGP) Lessons</h5>
<p>CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental
social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions.
The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help
strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive
peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas - Cyber
Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health,
National Education, and Sexuality Education are explored and discussed
in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons. Curriculum
time is set aside within CCE (FTGP) lessons for the four NE Commemorative
Days</p>
<p>During CCE (FTGP) lessons, time is also allocated for P3-P6 students to
plan and implement projects where they can contribute to school and community.
Through these opportunities, students learn to reflect on their experience,
put values into practice and think about how they can continue to contribute
meaningfully. Besides the level-based VIA, students are given everyday
responsibilities in the class so that they develop a sense of responsibility
and care for their own shared spaces.

<h5>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h5>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught in CCE (FTGP) at Primary
5 and 6. Students learn about physiological, social, and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
