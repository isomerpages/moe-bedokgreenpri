##### Social Studies
The Social Studies curriculum helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to Singapore and the world in which they live. Students are encouraged to inquire real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and field-based learning such as cohort learning journeys, students will  attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills and appreciate different perspectives.

##### National Education
National Education (NE), a significant aspect of CCE,  aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in our students, confidence in our nationâ€™s future. Anchoring on the citizenship dispositions: to have a sense of belonging, hope, reality and a will to act, NE also emphasizes on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore through SS lessons,  commemoration of NE core events and other NE activities and programmes such as Newsflash NE Show  and TIDE lessons in the school.
