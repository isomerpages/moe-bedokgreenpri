<h5>Social Studies</h5>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum helps students to grow in knowledge, develop
skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to
Singapore and the world in which they live. Students are encouraged to
inquire real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and
field-based learning such as cohort learning journeys, students will attain
relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical
and reflective thinking skills and appreciate different perspectives.</p>

<h5>National Education</h5>
<p>National Education (NE), a significant aspect of CCE, aims to develop
national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and
instill in our students, confidence in our nationâ€™s future. Anchoring on
the citizenship dispositions: to have a sense of belonging, hope, reality
and a will to act, NE also emphasizes on cultivating a sense of belonging
and emotional rootedness to Singapore through SS lessons, commemoration
of NE core events and other NE activities and programmes such as Newsflash
NE Show and TIDE lessons in the school.</p>
