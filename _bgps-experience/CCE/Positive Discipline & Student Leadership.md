<h4>Positive Discipline in BGPS</h4>
<p>In BGPS, we believe that discipline helps develop important character
traits such as resilience, responsibility and integrity. It teaches students
to make informed choices and take ownership of their actions. These skills
are essential for successes in the students' academics and later in life.</p>
<p>Students learn best in a safe, orderly and supportive environment. Hence,
our teachers work hard to create and maintain a school and classroom environment
that supports student learning and one which is conducive for developing
good student behaviour.</p>
<p>In enacting positive discipline, the school goes beyond ensuring behavioural
compliance in students according to school rules and regulations. It involves
an educative process where it takes into account individual circumstances
and offer opportunities for growth and learning from mistakes. Disciplinary
measures thus serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made.
Students are guided to understand that their actions carry consequences,
and they must learn to take responsibility of their actions. Parents/Guardians
can refer to the Student Handbook for the set of the school rules and regulations.</p>
