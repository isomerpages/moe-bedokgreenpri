#### Objectives: <br>
To provide students with a culture of care and conducive learning environment.

#### Key Programmes / Activities: 
##### Peer Support Relationships (PSR) 
At BGPS, we believe that building positive relationships through care, kindness, and respect is essential for creating a strong society and nation. 
We prioritize meeting students' basic psychological needs by ensuring they feel safe to take risks, connected and accepted by peers and teachers, and empowered to choose activities that align with their interests. This approach helps students feel competent and in control of their learning outcomes.

Positive peer relationships are crucial in providing care, fostering a sense of belonging, and building resilience. These relationships also serve as powerful channels for positive influence, student voice, and empowerment. At our school, nurturing these connections is key to creating a supportive and thriving community. 

There are two tiers of implementation of PSR@BGPS<br>
Tier 1: Every student a peer supporter<br>
Tier 2: Peer Support Champions (Class committee), CCA leaders and student councillors as Peer Support Leaders (PSL) to lead, champion and advocate PSR efforts

Aside from being good peer supporters, the school also takes an upstream approach in dealing with bullying. We have our “Bullying prevention week” to teach our students to be “upstanders” and to be a buddy, not a bully.

##### Cyber Wellness 
Cyber Wellness (CW) in CCE focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

Through CW education in CCE, students learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of technology and be a positive peer influence, advocating for the good of the community online.

These are the key messages which BGPians will understand:<br>
1.	Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities<br>
2.	Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence<br>
3.	Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace

Our programmes include “Safer internet week”, recess activities and assembly talks.
