Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students' holistic education. CCAs help children discover and cultivate their interests, talents and deepen their sense of belonging and responsibility to school, community and nation.  
  
As the school recognises the significant role CCAs play in your child's education journey, the programme is carried out during curriculum time on Friday mornings for all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students to participate.   
  
Here at BGPS, we offer a total of 14 CCAs, made up from these 4 broad categories:  

*   Clubs and Societies
*   Physical Sports
*   Uniformed Groups
*   Visual and Performing Arts
