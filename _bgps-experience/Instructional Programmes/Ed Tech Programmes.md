<h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<h3>Be Digitally Lit! @ BGPS</h3>
<p>In line with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 to strengthen the development
of students’ digital literacy and technological skills, our school embarked
on the Be Digitally Lit! @ BGPS programme to promote our students’ digital
literacy through the 4-pronged approach:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>B</u></strong>aseline knowledge - Exposure to knowledge through
school-based initiatives (e.g. Safer Internet Week)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>L</u></strong>evel-based programmes - Explicit teaching of
digital skills during level-wide programmes (e.g. P1-2 Touch Typing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>I</u></strong>ndependent learning - Self-study of digital skills
through self-paced SLS lessons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>T</u></strong>each within curriculum - Infuse the teaching
of digital skills into the various curriculum subjects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some highlights of the programme are shared in the following paragraphs.</p>
<h3>Infusing of Digital Skills within curriculum</h3>
<p>Digital skills such as the creation of digital artefacts, online communication
tools and citation are taught within curriculum subjects across various
subjects. After teachers’ explicit teaching and guidance, students will
apply the digital skill that they have learnt in small individual/team
projects. Examples include sending of emails to their teachers/peers during
English Language lessons, learning citation when doing Science projects,
and creating digital information posters during Mother Tongue lessons.</p>

<h3>Touch Typing (Primary 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
<p>Our school introduces touch typing to our Primary 1 &amp; 2 students as
we recognise the need to build the basic digital competency of keyboarding
skills. The platform in which they learn touch typing is game-infused and
fun, so that students remain engaged and motivated to type.</p>
<p>Rewards are given on the regular basis to recognise and motivate students
to strive on in their typing journey. Recess activities are also carried
for students to gather for some healthy “competition”!</p>

<h3>National Digital Explorer (Primary 4 &amp; 5)</h3>
<p>Our school has been taking part in the National Digital Explorer (NDE),
which is a nationwide digital literacy initiative co-organised by the Crescent
Girls’ School and ICDL Asia. Through this programme, interested students
will be equipped with key skills and knowledge on the effective use of
office productivity tools.</p>
<p>Students learn to be self-directed learners as they need to take ownership
of this programme by learning the computer applications and productivity
tools. Students who showed potential in this area have the opportunity
to compete at the National Round of NDE. Our students did well to obtain
a Gold and Bronze Award in NDE 2023.</p>

<h3>Code For Fun (Primary 5)</h3>
<p>An MOE-initiated programme, the Code for Fun programme includes learning
of computational thinking concepts using visual-based programming language,
combining it with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers, to create an engaging
coding experience for the students.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Throughout Term 1, our P5 students were given the opportunity to work
with Sphero Bolt. They used block-based programming to programme the Sphero
Bolt to complete the various tasks covering different movements and colours,
as well as the use of sensors and loop functions.</p>

<p>Through Code For Fun, we hope that students will be equipped with basic
coding and computational thinking skills, and most importantly, experience
joy and interest in coding.</p>
<h3>Coding, Info-communication &amp; Media Competitions (Upper Primary)</h3>
<p>To challenge and maximise student talents, Infocomm &amp; Media CCA students
take part in various coding and media-related competitions to apply their
coding knowledge and showcase their projects beyond school platforms. Some
competitions include the Swift Explorer Singapore (SES) and Our School,
Our Stories.</p>
