<h3>STELLAR Curriculum for P1 to P6</h3>
<p>The overarching aim of the EL Syllabus 2020 is to <strong>develop effective and affective language use in the students</strong>.
The STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading) curriculum
aims to strengthen students’ foundation in literacy skills through a variety
of learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches
using Big Books and authentic children’s text.</p>
<p>The vision of STELLAR is to inculcate in children the love for reading
and build a strong foundation in the English Language. STELLAR is currently
being implemented from Primary 1 to 6.</p>

Programme and Book Character/Gratitude Day activities to cultivate an interest
in reading amongst our students.&nbsp;</p>

together with the People’s Association (PA) and four self-help groups to
promote the love of reading and cultivate good reading habits among children.
