<h3>Empowered To Read Too (ETRT)</h3>
<p>The Empowered To Read Too (ETRT) Programmes is implemented at Primary
1 and Primary 2 to providing literacy support for students not placed in
the Learning Support Programme but still struggling to read independently.
The programme aims to enable students to be fluent readers by using games
and grade-appropriate texts to teach recognition of high frequency words
and reading fluency. Lessons are conducted daily by EL trained teachers
for 30 minutes per session. Students’ progress are monitored regularly.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</h3>
<p>LSP is a specialised early intervention programme meant to provide support
to children entering P1 with weak English language and literacy skills.
Students are identified through the Early Literacy Indicators, a group
screening instrument developed by MOE, at the beginning of each year. LSP
Lessons are conducted daily for 30 minutes per session. LSP is taught by
qualified Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs) who have been trained by
MOE HQ to implement the programme.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</h3>
<p>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme is a two-year intervention
programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for
support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at
the end of the Primary 2 Learning Support Programme. The programme aims
to enable students to read and spell independently and to understand a
variety of texts using comprehension strategies.</p>
<h3>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</h3>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) is a literacy support programme
implemented at Primary 3 and Primary 4 to support students with reading
difficulties but who do not have dyslexia. Lessons are conducted twice

During the lessons, students will learn various strategies to help them
in word recognition, oral reading fluency and reading comprehension.</p>
<p>The Primary 5 Reading Remediation Programme (P5 RRP) is a&nbsp;<strong>structured approach&nbsp;</strong>for
providing&nbsp;<strong>remediation </strong>to low progress learners taking
Standard English Language, to enable them to read&nbsp;<strong>with fluency&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;understanding.</strong>&nbsp;It
also ensures continuity of support for students in P4 RRP and School-based
Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) taking Standard EL who are still facing
