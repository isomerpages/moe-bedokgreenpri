<p>Our approach to teaching math is centered around hands-on learning experiences
that make math both fun and meaningful for our students. We use a variety
of math manipulatives, such as fraction discs, play money, and other interactive
tools, to help students visualise and understand mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>By incorporating real-world contexts into our lessons, we aim to enhance
student learning and deepen their conceptual understanding. Our goal is
to instill a love for math and to equip our students with the skills they
need to succeed in their academic journey and beyond.</p>

<p>Our Math@Home program is designed specifically for lower primary students.
Math@Home provides an platform for parents and children to connect and
bond over the holidays through a series of engaging real-world activities
that allow children to apply mathematical concepts learned in the classroom
to everyday situations.</p>
<p>Whether it's measuring ingredients for a recipe, budgeting for a small
project or making observations of the shapes that can be found all around,
these activities are crafted to be both educational and fun.</p>
<p>By integrating math into daily routines, Math@Home helps children see
the relevance and importance of math in their lives, enhancing their understanding
and appreciation of the subject.</p>

<p>We enhance student learning through the effective use of e-pedagogy. Our
curriculum incorporates the use of various apps and technology to support
and enrich the learning experience. By utilising these tools, we promote
student engagement, better mathematical communication, and collaboration
among students.</p>
<p>This approach helps cater to different learning styles, making math more
accessible and engaging for all. Our goal is to create an interactive and
supportive environment where students can thrive and develop a deeper understanding
of mathematical concepts.</p>

<p>Our problem-solving approach, UC3, is rooted in George Pólya's problem-solving
principles.</p>
<p>UC3, which stands for Understand, Choose, Carry out, and Check, is integrated
into the curriculum to enhance students' problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>Using this structured problem-solving approach, students begin by thoroughly
Understanding the problem, identifying all given data and the problem's
requirements.</p>
<p>They then Choose an appropriate strategy, selecting from techniques such
as drawing diagrams or applying logical reasoning.</p>
<p>With a strategy in place, students Carry out their plan by performing
calculations and following steps systematically.</p>
<p>Finally, they Check their work for accuracy of their solution and reflecting
on the overall process.</p>
<p>By embedding UC3 into daily instruction, we aim to help students improve
their mathematical skills and develop a systematic and reflective approach
to problem-solving that is applicable across various subject disciplines.</p>
