<h3><strong>Vision</strong>&nbsp;<br></h3>
<p>A scientist in every student</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3>
<h4><br>1) Customising curriculum to deepen students' learning using the Expose-Enrich-Excel approach. </h4>
<h4>2) Inquiry based learning </h4>
<h2></h2>
<p>The customised Science curriculum which is anchored on Inquiry-based Learning
(IBL) seeks to stimulate students’ curiosity and interest in the world
around them by building in students a strong foundation in scientific concepts
of reasoning and analytical skills in problem-solving and decision making.
It also equips them with ethics and attitudes to engage in Science-related
experiences as reflective citizens.</p>
