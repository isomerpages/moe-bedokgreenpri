<h4>Science Busking</h4>
<p>Students take part in Science Busking organised by the Science Centre
Singapore, where they design and conduct live, hands-on demonstrations
to explain scientific concepts in engaging and interactive ways. Through
this authentic experience, students deepen their conceptual understanding,
develop confidence in public speaking, and strengthen their communication
skills as they make science accessible and meaningful to diverse audiences.</p>

<h4>Sony Creative Science Award</h4>
<p>Students unleash their creativity through the annual Sony Creative Science
Award (SCSA), Singapore’s largest national toy-making competition for primary
school students. Organised by Science Centre Singapore and the Sony Group
of Companies in Singapore, with the support of the Ministry of Education,
SCSA offers students a hands-on platform to bring creative ideas to life
while learning science through play.</p>

<h4>e-THINK Challenge</h4>
<p>Students take part in the e-THINK Challenge, organised by Temasek Junior
College, where Primary 5 and 6 learners apply creative thinking and scientific
knowledge to solve real-world problems. Using themed challenges and video
submissions, students communicate their understanding of concepts such
as thermal physics and simple machines, while strengthening inquiry skills
and 21st-century competencies.</p>
