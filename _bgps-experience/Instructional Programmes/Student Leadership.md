#### **Vision**<br>
**Every BGPian, an aspiring leader who pursues excellence and embraces innovation**. He/she also initiates with drive, problem-solves and serves with empathy. 

**Student Leadership Framework**<br>
Guided by the school vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character, the Student Leadership Framework is developed to nurture BGPians to lead, serve and aspire. <br>
In BGPS, we believe that there is a leader in every BGPian, and every student can lead. In the first tier of self-leadership, the school sets the foundation for every BGPian to be able to lead self. In the second tier of team leadership, structured platforms are provided for students to serve their peers and those around them. Lastly, in the third tier of servant leadership, the school envisages that through opportunities provided for students, they will be able to advocate a transformation in the school and beyond.
