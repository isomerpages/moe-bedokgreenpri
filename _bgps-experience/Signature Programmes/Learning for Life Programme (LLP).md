<h5>Mission</h5>
<p>Inculcating values in students through learning experiences in the physical
and aesthetics domain</p>
<h5>Objectives and Rationale</h5>
<p>In alignment with our school’s mission to empower BGPians to learn how
to learn and succeed, and to nurture them to be confident persons and concerned
citizens, <strong>S</strong>ports and Aesthetics <strong>T</strong>o <strong>R</strong>e<strong>I</strong>nforce <strong>V</strong>alues <strong>E</strong>ducation
(STRIVE@BGPS) seeks to inculcate values in students so as to develop their <strong>character and citizenship</strong> through
learning experiences in the physical and aesthetics domains. Congruent
to the school’s philosophy that <strong>‘Every Child Matters’</strong>, <em>STRIVE@BGPS</em> is
designed to equip every student with the necessary knowledge, skills and
attitude to lead a life-long, physically-active lifestyle.</p>
<p>Students are given varied <strong>learning opportunities</strong> in both
the sports and aesthetics domains, developing them with competencies necessary
for the Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) world. More importantly,
school values like <strong>integrity, resilience, responsibility, respect</strong> and <strong>compassion</strong> as
well as the Olympic values of <strong>excellence, respect</strong> and <strong>friendship</strong> are
reinforced to help them learn how to relate to others and shape expected
behaviours.</p>

<h5>Museum-Based Learning with Social Contemporary Project</h5>
<p>Primary 4 students are introduced to the concept of National Identity
through Museum-Based Learning (MBL). Learning about Singapore's past through
art and visual artefacts is enriched through multi-disciplinary collaboration.
In alignment with CCE, Family Education is imbibed into MBL, which enhances
national identity by grounding the importance of family in our local context.
As a post-MBL activity, Primary 4 students get the opportunity to create
board games based on national identity through the Social Contemporary
Project. These board games are used to educate our international students
about Singapore's identity, from local food to places and events that make
Singapore unique. Through the Social Contemporary Project, both local and
international students will develop a deeper appreciation for Singapore
as they play these self-created board games.</p>
