<h3><strong>Desired Student Outcomes of the BGPS Total Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>To prepare BGPians for the Future of Learning, the BGPS Total Curriculum
Framework sets the focus and direction for the school’s curriculum and
co-curriculum to achieve the school’s vision of Empowered Learners, Persons
of Strength and Character. The vision is unpacked as Desired Student Outcomes
(DSOs) that are also called Behavioural Indicators as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; A Learner who Takes Ownership (of Own Actions and Own Learning)</h4>
<p>BGPS seeks to develop <strong>A Learner who Takes Ownership</strong> of
his own actions and own learning, and who displays the values of responsibility
and integrity. BGPians take charge of themselves by taking pride in their
own work, distinguishing right from wrong, and making responsible choices.
They are also curious and inventive as they display a lively curiosity
about their surroundings, have awareness of the arts, and can innovate
and solve problems. They also take the initiative in their learning as
demonstrated in the learning dispositions of ownership (<em>make efforts to do work with pride, complete learning tasks proactively</em>)
and resourcefulness (<em>explore and discover new learning and new ideas with joy, find solutions to problems from multiple perspectives</em>).</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; A Person who is Resilient (in the Face of Hard Work and Challenges)</h4>
<p>In this rapidly evolving world, the school is committed to helping the
BGPian to become <strong>A Person who is Resilient</strong> in the face of
hard work and challenges. BGPians strive for their personal best by being
determined to improve and succeed, organising and planning ahead, and having
healthy habits. BGPians are also self-assured through awareness of their
own strengths and areas for growth, have a sense of self-worth and are
able to think for and express themselves confidently. These would be demonstrated
through the learning dispositions of perseverance (<em>keep working at a task or challenge to complete it, do not give up because of failures or mistakes but strive to do better</em>)
and engagement (<em>reflect and contribute thoughtfully to discussions of learning activities, ask questions to deepen understanding</em>).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; A Person who Cares for One Another (including the Community and the Environment)</h4>
<p>BGPS places strong emphasis on character and values education with the
goal to nurture <strong>A Person who Cares for One Another. </strong>As
citizens of the world, BGPians will have empathy to cooperate, share, and
care for others as well as the environment. They appreciate diversity and
value inclusivity. They will also feel a sense of belonging as they grow
to know and love BGPS and Singapore.</p>
<p>Taking cognisance of the three DSOs above, the BGPS Total Curriculum Framework
outlines the school’s beliefs towards teaching and learning, the broad
approaches proposed for the total curriculum, focus areas as well as learning
experiences that are designed with BGPians in mind.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BGPS Vision</strong></h3>
<p>The Total Curriculum Framework is centred on the<em> </em>BGPS<em> </em>Vision
of developing “<em>Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character”, </em>and
the BGPS Mission, “<em>To empower BGPians to learn how to learn and succeed, and nurture them to be confident persons and concerned citizens”.</em>
</p>
<h3><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beliefs towards Teaching and Learning</strong></h3>
<p>The school’s beliefs towards teaching and learning: “<em>Every child is unique and should be well-supported</em>”
and <em>“Every child can learn, wants to learn and can do well”</em> are
in alignment with the BGPS philosophy of <em>“Every child matters”.</em>
</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Every child is unique and should be well-supported.</h4>
<p>BGPS recognises that all BGPians are distinctive individuals who learn
differently, and it is the BGPS educator’s role to ensure that customised
support for BGPians’ holistic development and growth is provided.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Every child can learn, wants to learn, and can do well.</h4>
<p>BGPS believes that every BGPian has the capacity and will to learn and
succeed and BGPS educators have to harness this well to help them fulfil
their utmost potential.</p>
<h3><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broad Approaches towards Teaching and Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Taking reference from the school’s beliefs, three broad approaches for
the BGPS Total Curriculum Framework have been outlined:</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Enable All Learners</h4>
<p>BGPS educators need to understand BGPians’ needs to make learning accessible
for them in support of their attainment of knowledge, skills, and competencies.</p>
<p>BGPS seeks to cultivate an inclusive perspective where BGPS educators
understand, value and accommodate diverse learning needs of BGPians. BGPS
educators understand and value BGPians’ learning differences and work towards
making learning inclusive through appropriate support, intervention-based
initiatives, and strengths-based approaches to talent development, because
of the school’s belief that every BGPian is a unique individual with intrinsic
worth. In enabling all learners, it is aspired for BGPians to be more self-aware
of their strengths and areas for growth as they are not only supported,
but feel supported, in developing their talents in various domains.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Enrich Students’ Learning</h4>
<p>BGPS aims to contextualise learning for BGPians to broaden their perspectives
of the world around them. In contextualising learning, BGPS seeks to deepen
and broaden BGPians’ thinking through exposure to world affairs, contemporary
issues, and global concerns in a localised lens. Through these authentic
contexts, students will develop critical Emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (E21CCs) and globalised perspectives, and work towards being
advocates for the environment.</p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; Empower Learners to be Future-ready</h4>
<p>The future world that BGPians will be navigating through is constantly
evolving into one that is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.
Being future-ready means that BGPians must develop habits, dispositions
and competencies that are critical for the future. They will need to work
on building their socio-emotional competencies, developing positive dispositions,
and mastering digital literacies. Strong emphasis will also be placed on
the development of a growth mindset, 7 Habits and building of healthy habits
for them to develop resilience and adaptability.</p>
<h3><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus Areas</strong></h3>
<p>The focus areas are actualised through the various learning experiences
that our students go through. The curriculum and co-curriculum learning
experiences are broadly categorised as follows:</p>
