<h3><strong>Desired Student Outcomes of the BGPS Total Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>To prepare BGPians for the Future of Learning, the BGPS Total Curriculum
Framework sets the focus and direction for the school’s curriculum and
co-curriculum to achieve the school’s vision of Empowered Learners, Persons
of Strength and Character. The vision is unpacked as Desired Student Outcomes
(DSOs) that are also called Behavioural Indicators as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; A Learner who Takes Ownership (of Own Actions and Own Learning)</h4>
<p>BGPS seeks to develop <strong>A Learner who Takes Ownership</strong> of
his own actions and own learning, and who displays the values of responsibility
and integrity. BGPians take charge of themselves by taking pride in their
own work, distinguishing right from wrong, and making responsible choices.
They are also curious and inventive as they display a lively curiosity
about their surroundings, have awareness of the arts, and can innovate
and solve problems. They also take the initiative in their learning as
demonstrated in the learning dispositions of ownership (<em>make efforts to do work with pride, complete learning tasks proactively</em>)
and resourcefulness (<em>explore and discover new learning and new ideas with joy, find solutions to problems from multiple perspectives</em>).</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; A Person who is Resilient (in the Face of Hard Work and Challenges)</h4>
<p>In this rapidly evolving world, the school is committed to helping the
BGPian to become <strong>A Person who is Resilient</strong> in the face of
hard work and challenges. BGPians strive for their personal best by being
determined to improve and succeed, organising and planning ahead, and having
healthy habits. BGPians are also self-assured through awareness of their
own strengths and areas for growth, have a sense of self-worth and are
able to think for and express themselves confidently. These would be demonstrated
through the learning dispositions of perseverance (<em>keep working at a task or challenge to complete it, do not give up because of failures or mistakes but strive to do better</em>)
and engagement (<em>reflect and contribute thoughtfully to discussions of learning activities, ask questions to deepen understanding</em>).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; A Person who Cares for One Another (including the Community and the Environment)</h4>
<p>BGPS places strong emphasis on character and values education with the
goal to nurture <strong>A Person who Cares for One Another. </strong>As
citizens of the world, BGPians will have empathy to cooperate, share, and
care for others as well as the environment. They appreciate diversity and
value inclusivity. They will also feel a sense of belonging as they grow
to know and love BGPS and Singapore.</p>
<p>Taking cognisance of the three DSOs above, the BGPS Total Curriculum Framework
outlines the school’s beliefs towards teaching and learning, the broad
approaches proposed for the total curriculum, focus areas as well as learning
experiences that are designed with BGPians in mind.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BGPS Vision</strong></h3>
<p>The Total Curriculum Framework is centred on the<em> </em>BGPS<em> </em>Vision
of developing “<em>Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character”, </em>and
the BGPS Mission, “<em>To empower BGPians to learn how to learn and succeed, and nurture them to be confident persons and concerned citizens”.</em>
</p>
<h3><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beliefs towards Teaching and Learning</strong></h3>
<p>The school’s beliefs towards teaching and learning: “<em>Every child is unique and should be well-supported</em>”
and <em>“Every child can learn, wants to learn and can do well”</em> are
in alignment with the BGPS philosophy of <em>“Every child matters”.</em>
</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Every child is unique and should be well-supported.</h4>
<p>BGPS recognises that all BGPians are distinctive individuals who learn
differently, and it is the BGPS educator’s role to ensure that customised
support for BGPians’ holistic development and growth is provided.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Every child can learn, wants to learn, and can do well.</h4>
<p>BGPS believes that every BGPian has the capacity and will to learn and
succeed and BGPS educators have to harness this well to help them fulfil
their utmost potential.</p>
<h3><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broad Approaches towards Teaching and Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Taking reference from the school’s beliefs, three broad approaches for
the BGPS Total Curriculum Framework have been outlined:</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Enable All Learners</h4>
<p>BGPS educators need to understand BGPians’ needs to make learning accessible
for them in support of their attainment of knowledge, skills, and competencies.</p>
<p>BGPS seeks to cultivate an inclusive perspective where BGPS educators
understand, value and accommodate diverse learning needs of BGPians. BGPS
educators understand and value BGPians’ learning differences and work towards
making learning inclusive through appropriate support, intervention-based
initiatives, and strengths-based approaches to talent development, because
of the school’s belief that every BGPian is a unique individual with intrinsic
worth. In enabling all learners, it is aspired for BGPians to be more self-aware
of their strengths and areas for growth as they are not only supported,
but feel supported, in developing their talents in various domains.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Enrich Students’ Learning</h4>
<p>BGPS aims to contextualise learning for BGPians to broaden their perspectives
of the world around them. In contextualising learning, BGPS seeks to deepen
and broaden BGPians’ thinking through exposure to world affairs, contemporary
issues, and global concerns in a localised lens. Through these authentic
contexts, students will develop critical Emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (E21CCs) and globalised perspectives, and work towards being
advocates for the environment.</p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; Empower Learners to be Future-ready</h4>
<p>The future world that BGPians will be navigating through is constantly
evolving into one that is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.
Being future-ready means that BGPians must develop habits, dispositions
and competencies that are critical for the future. They will need to work
on building their socio-emotional competencies, developing positive dispositions,
and mastering digital literacies. Strong emphasis will also be placed on
the development of a growth mindset, 7 Habits and building of healthy habits
for them to develop resilience and adaptability.</p>
<h3><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus Areas</strong></h3>
<p>In support of the three broad approaches, six focus areas have been identified:</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Purpose-driven Assessment and Feedback</h4>
<p>Assessment and feedback are integral to BGPians’ learning progress. The
design of assessment and feedback has to be fit for purpose for both the
BGPS educator and the BGPian. Data gleaned from such purposeful assessment
and feedback will help the BGPS educator deepen his understanding of BGPians’
needs. BGPians themselves will also gain self-awareness to reflect on their
strengths and areas for growth.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Differentiated</h4>
<p>Based on the insight gleaned from purposeful assessment and feedback,
learning can then be differentiated so that BGPS can bring out the best
in every BGPian, regardless of their needs, strengths, and areas for growth.
Thus, to foster students’ growth, learning is specially designed to cater
to BGPians’ varied interests, talents and abilities.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; Authentic and Experiential</h4>
<p>BGPS aims to expose BGPians to real-world contexts and perspectives and
to provide opportunities for sense-making, deepening and application of
learning. This means providing BGPians with opportunities for them to be
curious about the world around them, think critically, adaptively and inventively
to problem-solve, and communicate confidently and effectively while working
collaboratively.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(d)&nbsp; Global-minded</h4>
<p>Being global-minded means that BGPians need to be exposed to the world
they live in and the global issues that affect them. Thereafter, they will
need to discover how they connect and fit into that world. Coupled with
the right values and civic literacies, BGPS aims to nurture advocates with
a willingness to take action on global issues while remaining rooted to
BGPS and Singapore as citizens of the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(e)&nbsp; Future-oriented</h4>
<p>In an ever-evolving world, it is important for BGPians to develop soft
skills like flexibility, adaptability, time management and conflict resolution.
These will help them navigate any situation that they will eventually encounter.
Besides soft skills, they will also need to pick up healthy habits and
coping mechanisms to develop good physical, mental and emotional health.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(f)&nbsp; Tech-enabled</h4>
<p>With educational technology as a key enabler for the Future of Learning,
BGPS is committed to developing BGPians to have the knowledge, skills,
competencies, and values for them to be savvy digital learners as they
navigate the online environment and digital space.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>The following describe the various learning experiences that BGPians are
expected to undertake through the total curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Core Learning Domains</h4>
<p>Core Learning Domains serve as the foundation of the holistic BGPS educational
experience. These domains – Languages (English and Mother Tongue Languages),
Sciences (Mathematics and Science), Social Studies, CCE, Physical and Health
Education, and Aesthetics (Art and Music) – are thoughtfully designed to
develop BGPians across the cognitive (thinking), affective (feeling), and
psychomotor (physical) dimensions.</p>
<p>Through Sciences and Languages, BGPians sharpen their analytical and communication
abilities. CCE nurtures values and social-emotional growth, while Physical
and Health Education enhances motor skills and well-being. Aesthetics cultivates
creativity and artistic expression, and Social Studies facilitates BGPians’
understanding of their place in both Singapore and the wider world.</p>
<p>These interconnected learning areas, together with the appropriate learning
scaffolds, serve as the foundation of the holistic BGPS educational experience
that prepares BGPians for future challenges while nurturing their individual
strengths and interests.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; E2@BGPS</h4>
<p>E2@BGPS, Environmental Education at Bedok Green Primary School aims to
evoke curiosity in environmental issues by connecting classroom learning
with real-life application of concepts in such issues. It seeks to develop
inventive thinking by encouraging a dare-to-try makers’ spirit and mindset
in solving authentic environmental problems. BGPians are equipped with
the knowledge and practical know-hows in four learning domains; namely,
biodiversity and natural environment, resources and sustainability, waste
pollution and management control and alternative energies.</p>
<p>The learning outcomes of E2@BGPS are:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase <u>A</u>wareness of environmental issues</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve <u>A</u>ttitude towards environmental conservation
and protection</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>A</u>cquire knowledge and know-hows on environmental
issues</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take <u>A</u>ction to help tackle environment
issues</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; STRIVE@BGPS</h4>
<p>STRIVE@BGPS, <strong>S</strong>ports and Aesthetics&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>o&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>e<strong>I</strong>nforce&nbsp;<strong>V</strong>alues&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>ducation
at Bedok Green Primary School, aims to provide opportunities in Sports
and Aesthetics, including games, play-based and outdoor activities, for
joyful, real-life application of life skills, reinforcing values and supporting
personal growth. It seeks to foster a positive sense of self, cultivating
interests and habits that support a healthy, well-balanced social life
through adapting, experimenting and engaging in continual self-discovery
of learning. Anchored on the CCE2021 and 7 Habits, explicit teaching is
carried out to teach self-assurance, self-management and relationship management.
Opportunities in Sports and Aesthetics, including games, play-based and
outdoor activities are provided for BGPians to reflect on and apply the
learning, reinforcing their acquisition of critical life skills in the
learning domains of personal confidence, emotional regulation and relating
with others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning outcomes of STRIVE@BGPS are:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resilient individual who dares to try</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A self-assured performer who contributes actively</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team player who relates well with others</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(d)&nbsp; High Ability Learners (HAL) Programme</h4>
<p>BGPS' High Ability Learners (HAL) Programme identifies and nurtures High
Ability BGPians through targeted development in academics, sports, aesthetics,
and leadership.</p>
<p>Through signature programmes like E2K Math, E2K Science, Green Makers
(with Design Thinking), Debate, Artist-In-School Scheme, Little Reporter
and Junior Coders, High Ability BGPians are challenged to develop critical
perspectives on issues, innovative and inventive thinking, problem-solving
skills and communication skills, while pursuing their interests.</p>
<p>The school’s multi-disciplinary approach ensures that High Ability BGPians
receive appropriate support and opportunities to maximise their potential
across different domains.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>(e)&nbsp; Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</h4>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of BGPians’ holistic
education. CCAs help them discover and cultivate their interests and talents.
CCAs provide platforms for BGPians to develop their character, learn values,
social emotional competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them
for future challenges. CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together.
By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships
and deepen their sense of belonging to &nbsp;BGPS, community and Singapore.</p>
<p>As BGPS recognises the significant role CCAs play in BGPians’ education
journey, CCAs are carried out during curriculum time on Friday mornings
and mandatory for all Primary 3 to Primary 6 BGPians.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(f)&nbsp; Lead Programme</h4>
<p>The Lead Programme aims to nurture BGPians to become confident and capable
leaders who make a positive impact in BGPS and contribute to the immediate
community around the school.</p>
<p>Guided by the principles of Lead, Serve and Aspire, the programme aims
to develop BGPians into leaders who lead with confidence through their
actions and decisions, empower one another to serve the school and the
community, and aspire together to drive change for the betterment of BGPS
and the community.</p>
<p>BGPian student leaders are equipped with essential leadership skills,
strong character values, and the courage to step forward and make a difference.
Through various leadership opportunities and guided mentoring, they learn
to become role models who inspire their peers and contribute meaningfully
to life in BGPS and the community.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(g)&nbsp; Overseas Learning Experience (OLE)</h4>
<p>Overseas Learning Experience (OLE) is an important enrichment programme
that is part of the total curriculum. Through carefully planned overseas
activities and experiences, it aims to nurture participants into globally-aware
citizens. BGPians who would benefit most from OLE are identified from their
profiles, interests, parent nominations and teachers’ recommendations.
During OLE, they engage in meaningful cultural exchanges, classroom immersions,
and experiential learning activities. These experiences develop their cross-cultural
competencies, deepen their appreciation of Singapore's place in the world,
and strengthen their sense of national identity while fostering empathy
and respect for diverse perspectives and cultures.</p>
