<h2>BGPS Total Curriculum Framework</h2>
<p>To prepare our students for the Future of Learning, the BGPS Total Curriculum
Framework sets the focus and direction for our school’s curriculum and
co-curriculum to achieve our desired student outcomes of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A Responsible Learner who Takes Ownership (of Own Actions and Own Learning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Confident Person who is Resilient (in the Face of Hard Work and Challenges)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Compassionate Person who Cares for one another (including the Community
and the Environment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The BGPS Total Curriculum Framework outlines our beliefs towards teaching
and learning, the broad approaches towards total curriculum, focus areas
as well as learning experiences that were designed with our students in
mind.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our School Vision</strong></h3>
<p>At the heart of the BGPS Total Curriculum Framework, we are guided by <em>our school’s </em>Vision
of developing “<em>Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character”. </em>Cascasding
further down is our School’s Mission “<em>To empower BGPians to learn how to learn and succeed, and nurture them to be confident persons and concerned citizens”.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Beliefs towards Teaching and Learning</strong></h3>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Every child is unique and should be well-supported.</h4>
<p>We recognise that all our students are distinctive individuals who learn
differently, and it is our role to ensure that we provide customised supported
for their growth.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Every child can learn, wants to learn, and can do well.</h4>
<p>We believe that every BGPS student has the capacity and will to learn
and succeed and we have to harness this well to help them fulfil their
utmost potential.</p>
<h3><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Broad Approaches towards Teaching and Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Taking reference from our beliefs, we have outlined three broad approaches
for our BGPS Total Curriculum framework:</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Enable All Learners</h4>
<p>We cultivate an inclusive perspective where our teachers understand, value
and accommodate to diverse learning needs. We understand and value our
students’ learning differences and work towards making learning inclusive
through appropriate support, intervention-based initiatives, and strengths-based
approaches to talent development.</p>
<p>In enabling our learners, we also want them to develop awareness of their
strengths and areas of growth as we help them work towards developing their
talents in various domains.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Enrich Students’ Learning</h4>
<p>We aim to contextualise learning for our students to broaden their perspectives
of the world around them. We seek to deepen and broaden students’ learning
through exposure to world affairs, contemporary issues, and global concerns
through a localised lens. Through these, students will develop critical
21<sup>st</sup> century competencies, develop globalised perspectives and
work towards being advocates for the environment.</p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; Empower Learners to be Future-ready</h4>
<p>We understand that the future world our students will be navigating through
will be constantly evolving.</p>
<p>Being future-ready means that our students develop habits, dispositions
and competencies that are critical to adapt to the ever-changing world.</p>
<p>They will need to work on building their socio-emotional competencies,
developing positive dispositions, and mastering digital literacies. We
will also place strong emphasis on the development of a growth mindset,
7 Habits and building healthy habits for them to develop resilience and
adaptability.</p>
<h3><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Focus Areas</strong></h3>
<p>In support of the three broad approaches, six focus areas were identified:</p>
<h4>(a)&nbsp; Purpose-driven Assessment and Feedback</h4>
<p>Assessment and feedback are integral to our students’ learning progress.
We believe in designing assessment and feedback that is fit for purpose
for both teachers and students. Such data will help teachers deepen understanding
of our students’ needs and our students gain self-awareness to reflect
on their strengths and areas of growth. This will all come together to
help our students to move forward in their growth in various areas.</p>
<h4>(b)&nbsp; Differentiated</h4>
<p>Based on the insight gathered from purposeful assessment and feedback,
learning can be differentiated so that we can bring out the best in our
students, regardless of their needs, strengths, and areas for growth. Thus,
to foster students’ growth, learning is specially designed to cater to
our students’ varied interests, talents and abilities.</p>
<h4>(c)&nbsp; Authentic and Experiential</h4>
<p>We aim to expose students to real-world contexts and perspectives and
to provide opportunities for sense-making, deepening and application of
learning. This means providing students with opportunities for them to
be curious about the world around them, think critically, adaptively and
inventively to problem-solve, and communicate confidently and effectively
while working collaboratively.</p>
<h4>(d)&nbsp; Global-minded</h4>
<p>Being global-minded means that students need to be exposed to the world
they live in and the global issues that affect them. Thereafter, they will
need to discover how they connect and fit into that world. Coupled with
the right values, we aim to nurture advocates with a willingness to take
action on global issues while remaining rooted to our school and nation
as citizens of the world. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>(e)&nbsp; Future-oriented</h4>
<p>In an ever-evolving world, it is important for our students to develop
soft skills, like flexibility, adaptability, time management and conflict
resolution, that will help them to navigate any situation that they will
eventually encounter. Besides soft skills, they will also need to pick
up healthy habits and coping mechanisms to develop good physical, mental
and emotional health.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tech-enabled</h4>
<p>With educational technology as a key enabler for the Future of Learning,
we are committed to developing our students to have the knowledge, skills,
competencies, and values for them to be savvy digital learners as they
navigate the online environment and digital space.</p>
<h3><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>The focus areas are actualised through the various learning experiences
that our students go through. The curriculum and co-curriculum learning
experiences are broadly categorised as follows:</p>
