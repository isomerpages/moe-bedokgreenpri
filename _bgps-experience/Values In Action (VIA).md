Values in Action (VIA) forms an important part of character and citizenship education as it aims at building social cohesion and civic responsibility.

The school provides&nbsp;learning experiences that support studentsâ€™ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute actively to the school and community, through learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. Through these opportunities, students learn to take ownership over how they can contribute to the home, school &amp; community. They are able to reflect on their experience, put into practice the values and also think about how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.
