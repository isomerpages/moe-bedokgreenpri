### Overview of CCE@BGPS

CCE is integral to the holistic development of the students at BGPS. We are guided by the school values and school motto 'Persevere and Succeed' to help students realise the vision of being Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character. This is in line with the school's mission where we want to bring out every child's personal best. <br>

In BGPS, CCE is integrated and infused in both curriculum and co-curriculum programmes for an overall school experience of the students. 


### CCE Programmes
**Education and Career Guidance<br>**
Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare pupils for the 21st Century.

**MOE Sexuality Education in Schools 2023<br>**
1.      Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.

2.      The **Goals** of Sexuality Education are:<br>
(a)      To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate knowledge on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;<br>
(b)      To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of social and emotional skills of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and<br>
(c)      To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality.<br>

3.      The **Key Messages** of Sexuality Education are:<br>
(a)      Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;<br>
(b)      Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);<br>
(c)      Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and<br>
(d)      Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.<br>

b.      Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)<br>

Sexuality Education Lessons:<br>
3.      The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other sources.<br>

4.      Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 5.      In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. 


At Bedok Green Primary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2023:<br>
