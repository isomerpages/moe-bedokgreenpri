### Overview of CCE@BGPS

CCE is integral to the holistic development of the students at BGPS. We are guided by the school values and school motto 'Persevere and Succeed' to help students realise the vision of being Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character. This is in line with the school's mission where we want to bring out every child's personal best. <br>

In BGPS, CCE is integrated and infused in both curriculum and co-curriculum programmes for an overall school experience of the students. 


### CCE Programmes
**Education and Career Guidance<br>**
Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare pupils for the 21st Century.

**MOE Sexuality Education in Schools 2023<br>**
Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues. <br>
