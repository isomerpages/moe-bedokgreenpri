**Social Studies**   <br>
The Social Studies syllabus aims to provide students with a basic understanding of historical, geographical, economic and sociological knowledge at the primary level. As an integral part of instruction, there should be continuous assessment of students√≠ learning throughout the programme. In BGPS, students will be assessed through both formal and non-formal modes of assessment. Learning Journeys are also an integral part of BGPS NE & SS programme. It aims to extend and enrich the educational experience of our students. Learning Journeys will also broaden the mental horizons of our students and contribute to their holistic development.
