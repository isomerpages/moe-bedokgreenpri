##### Mission 

*   To equip pupils with the required ICT skills as well as imbuing them with the necessary values towards responsible use of technology.  
    
*   To develop an ICT-enriched environment focusing on the following 4 key areas:

*   Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment
    
*   Student Development
    
*   Professional Development of Staff
    
*   Resource and Knowledge Building
    

#### Key Programmes

**BGPS ICT Curriculum** <br>
The BGPS ICT Curriculum aims to equip students with a set of ICT skill competencies. These are essential knowledge, skills and values which students would need in order to thrive in a technology-driven society. 

  

The attainment of the ICT skills is spiral and structured into 2 progressive stages. The skills in the first Key Stage will be acquired from Primary 1 to 3 and the skills in the second Key Stage will be acquired from Primary 4 to 6. The school focuses on teaching thinking and process skills that are common and necessary across all core subjects, such as gathering and organising information. The ICT skills imparted range from basic operations (e.g. opening, saving and retrieving a file) to ICT process skills (e.g. using a spreadsheet to process data for analysis and search engines to retrieve current information).

**ICT-enriched Learning Experiences** <br>
To enrich students' learning experiences in the classrooms, the school adopts the active learning process (based on the SLS Pedagogical Scaffold 2.0) and infuses technology in teaching and learning across the curriculum. Through the active learning process, we aim to equip students with the skills and dispositions to be self-directed, collaborative, and future-ready digital learners.

As the school moves towards blended learning, we emphasise on both face-to-face interaction between peers and with the teacher, as well as adopting key applications of technology to promote engagement and efficacy in learning. Varied ICT-enriched learning experiences are planned and customised to better engage students, and also better monitor and assess their learning and close learning gaps.

**ICT-enabled Home Based Learning (HBL)**  <br>
In response to the COVID-19 situation, HBL has been implemented to reduce the risk of transmissions within the students and school. Through ICT-enabled Home Based Learning, the school uses information and communications technology to support, enhance and optimize the delivery of information. With the integration of technology in teaching and learning, students are actively engaged with learning objectives.  

We also ensure continuity of learning by minimizing loss of curriculum time while keeping students meaningfully engaged and occupied at home. Through various ICT tools and platforms, teachers continue to engage students and access their learning. Teachers also review students’ learning progress and provide support to help them cope with their learning at home.  

  

Students who require closer supervision or whose parents are frontline workers, can return to school on HBL days. These students will conduct their HBL according to the school’s planned schedule similar to those who are at home. Students can access the BGPS HBL Portal to view the schedule and work assigned to them for each subject for each day.
