BGPS Safer Internet Day
=======================

As part of Cyber Wellness education, Bedok Green Primary School commemorated Safer Internet Day 2019 on Thursday, 7 February 2019.

  

The theme for this year is **‘Together for a better internet’** which focuses on focus on how consent works in an online context and will ask young people to explore how they ask, give, and receive consent online. This could be in their friendships or relationships, how they take and share images and videos or how they manage their privacy and data.

SID 2019 encourages BGPians to explore how the internet works, who owns the information that is shared on it, and how they can actively take ownership of digital spaces. We want SID 2019 to **empower** BGPians to take control of their online lives and to feel that they can harness and use the positive power of the internet for good.
