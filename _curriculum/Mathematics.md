**Vision** <br>
To Be Analytical Thinkers and Problem Solvers

## Customizing our Instructional Approach

**Quality Teaching &amp; Learning in every classroom**

At BGPS, all Math teachers adopt the FREMC (Factual Fluency/ Readiness/ Engagement/ Mastery/ Consolidation) as a fundamental good mathematical teaching structure to guide the teaching and learning of Math for our students.&nbsp;

We also stress the use of Learning Experiences, Math Manipulatives and meaningful ICT tools in teaching Mathematics. These ensure that students are engaged in the learning of Math concepts through leveraging authentic contexts and technology, and Mathematics is made relevant to their daily lives.&nbsp;

  

To further cater to the varied learning needs and interests of our students, differentiated instruction is carried out in our classrooms and students of varied profiles can be gainfully engaged within the lesson. Formative assessment is also used to monitor student progress and to ensure that learning gaps are closed in a timely manner.

**UC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Approach to Math Problem Solving**

A whole school approach to problem-solving, UC³ exposes our students to world renowned mathematician George Polya’s prescription for solving problems. As we scaffold students’ learning with this problem solving approach, opportunities are also given for students to reason, communicate and connect their learning with prior knowledge and real world problems. UC³ also provides opportunities to promote students’ thinking skills and learning through heuristics, with the aim to build confident and logical thinkers.

**U** \- Understand the problem

**C** \- Choose a plan

**C**\- Carry out the plan

**C** \- Check the solution

  

## Fostering the Joy of Learning Mathematics&nbsp;

**Learn and Apply Math through Play (L.A.M.P)**

This programme is designed following MOE’s initiative to move beyond achieving&nbsp;strong academic results to instill in students the joy of learning. L.A.M.P not only helps to promote joyful learning among our students, it also provides students with greater engagement by learning Mathematical concepts through games and puzzles.&nbsp;

In line with the safe management measures of the last 2 years, L.A.M.P. has pivoted to become more of a classroom-based activity called BrainTeaserS or BTS. With BTS we have exposed students to real-world contexts. For instance, we have had BTS questions on the number of vaccine doses needed to vaccinate Bedok residents and seating arrangements in a restaurant according to prevailing group sizes. With BTS, our students are able to strengthen and apply their mathematical concepts in a stress-free environment and at the same time relate Math to their daily lives.

**Interdepartmental Collaboration**  

It takes a village to raise a child. It is an old adage that the Mathematics Department strongly believes in. As such, we have collaborated with various departments to widen the range of activities that we can offer to our students. Alongside the National Education/Social Studies Department, we have developed Math quizzes centered around the four National Education commemorative events.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

## Nurturing Students' Interests and Talents

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Math:**

In alignment with the school’s direction of fostering the <u><em>In-depth learning and enhancing student engagement</em></u>, the Math department started the E2K Mathematics (in 2019) as an enrichment to:

*   Develop high ability math learners (HAL) in BGPS in their mathematical reasoning skills and deepen conceptual understanding through an <u><em>inquiry approach</em></u>
    
*   Promote <u><em>joy in learning</em></u> and <u><em>greater engagement</em></u> by learning math concepts through story, games and puzzles
    
*   Develop habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies (21CC) such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
    

The E2K enrichment content is guided by the Gifted Education Branch (GEB) at the Ministry. Primary 4 students are engaged in E2K modules after school and learn higher-order mathematical problem solving skills through stories and games.

**Mathematics Olympiad Training Programme**  

The Mathematics Olympiad Training Programme is provided for high progress upper primary students with a special talent in Mathematics to enrich their learning. Students are equipped with a repertoire of problem-solving techniques to solve high-order and non-routine problems to hone their skills for competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Mathematics Olympiad Competitions**

In order to challenge and stretch students’ mathematical potential to promote greater interest in Mathematics, the school participates in the following Mathematics Olympiads annually:

• National Mathematical Olympiad Singapore (NMOS)

• Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS)

• Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO)

• Raffles Mathematical Olympiad (RMO)

 

**Learning Support in Mathematics:**  

The LSM programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics to students who need extra support in acquiring basic numeracy skills when they enter Primary One. It aims to provide help to students who lack numeracy skills.

  

All students who enter P1 sit for a screening exercise in Math (Early Numeracy Indicators). Students who are found to have weak numeracy skills are identified for LSM.

  

LSM support is for 2 years by trained teachers. BGPS adopts the withdrawal mode, which means LSM students are taken out of their regular classes during their Math periods and taught in a smaller class. The maximum class size is 8 students. The programme covers the P1/2 syllabus for all students.

  

The LSM programme focuses on building good mathematical understanding. It aims to build students’ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Math.

In order to support the LSM students and&nbsp; lift their baseline skills, further scaffolding is given in understanding a concept. Lessons are based on a specially designed package by MOE which also includes additional resources like magnetic ten frames, Floor Mat (for numbers to 100), Place Value Flip Chart, Big Books and many more.

For a fun and relaxed atmosphere while learning Math, the students can play simple Math games in small groups or in pairs at the Math Corner. Here, they are free to choose a Math activity and play with their friends independently.
