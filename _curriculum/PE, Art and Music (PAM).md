**Vision** <br>
Healthy body, fit-for-life &amp; every child engaged in the visual and performing arts

**Mission** <br>
Provide a comprehensive and balanced programme to help students develop a sound mind and healthy body and cultivate a life-long appreciation for the Arts

  

### Key Programmes
--------------

**The PE Programmes** <br>
The PE programme is tailored to equip students with the essential skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary for them to enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle.

In view of achieving the above objectives, various strategies are incorporated through the PE syllabus during lessons.

The strategies are nurturing and encourages fair play and teamwork during PE lessons and CCA sessions; debrief sessions after lessons where good values are given praise; grouping of students of different ability, gender and race; student self-officiating of games under teachers’ supervision; educating students on the need to follow rules and regulations to be enforced in a game and providing opportunities for group work, for example, planning, creating and performing a routine for learning areas of dance and gymnastics.

**Pre-Assembly Morning Exercises** <br>
Students participate in weekly pre-assembly exercise programme, led by student volunteers and teachers from the PE Committee. Such programmes provide additional platforms for our students to cultivate and engage in daily physical activities.

The school also organizes other forms of physical activities for selected level of students before morning assembly as we believe activities as such positively impacts the brain and improves cognition, mood, attention and academic achievement in students.

**Inter-Class Games** <br>
We believe inter-class games helps to promote greater participation in physical activities among students. At BGPS, we ensure maximum participation rate by ensuring all students take part during the planned activity.

Class Achievement certificates and Sportsmanship certificates are also awarded during the games as we hope students will continue to strive for excellence during sporting games, and able to demonstrate sportsmanship at the same time.

The school has taken a spiralled approach when planning the activities at this camp such that students will be exposed to higher levels of outdoor activities like zip-line, abseiling and high element obstacle course. The objectives of this programme focus on developing our students as independent individuals, building resilience as they learn to overcome challenges in times of difficulties faced.

### MUSIC 


The music curriculum in BGPS aims to provide students with a well-rounded musical education. Every child possesses innate musical qualities that could be harnessed and developed. BGPians can explore their environment through sounds and develop a connection with music through experiences that are meaningful and valuable. A wide range of genres and styles are introduced to put our BGPians in touch with their heritage as well as deepen their understanding of the cultural diversity of music in Singapore and the world.
<br>Our curriculum aims to:
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through Listening, Creating and Performing
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop abilities for creative expression and communication
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global cultures
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultivate a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music

BGPians experience group singing and choral activities that encourage teamwork and harmony. Instruments such as boom whackers, resonator bells, ukulele, percussion are introduced for Bgpians to have the opportunity to learn to play these instruments, fostering an early understanding of musical notation and rhythm. Fundamental music concepts includes basic notation, rhythm and musical symbols are taught to provide a foundation for further music studies. Students are also exposed to diverse range of music genres, styles and cultures, which helps develop their listening skills, musical appreciation and understanding of the cultural aspects of different music traditions. They are also engaged in simple composition exercises, allowing them to experiment with creating their own musical pieces.&nbsp;

In BGPS, we strongly believe that musicality is a natural and inherent quality in children. We hope to instil joy, and a sense of accomplishment in BGpians as they embark on their musical journey.
