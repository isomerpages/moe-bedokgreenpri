#### **Vision** <br>
A scientist in every student

#### Customising curriculum to deepen students' learning

In nurturing and developing in students an inquiring mind, the customised Science curriculum aims to equip students with the scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes for them to enjoy and value Science as an important tool to explore and learn more deeply about the world around them.  

The customised Science curriculum together with the other programmes, are aligned with the school’s teaching and learning approach, Expose-Enrich-Excel. Adopting the approach, the school not only engages students in acquiring core knowledge, skills and values, but also enriches their learning through application of scientific concepts and skills, and nurtures students’ interests and talents in the area of Science. It is contextualised into the Science curriculum as shown in the table and diagram below.

## The Inquiry-Based Learning Curriculum

The customised Science curriculum which is anchored on Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) seeks to stimulate students’ curiosity and interest in the world around them by building in students a strong foundation in scientific concepts, knowledge and skills to help them in the development of reasoning and analytical skills in problem-solving and decision making. It also equips them with ethics and attitudes to engage in Science-related experiences as reflective citizens.

The spiral curriculum from Primary 3 to 6 are based on the themes, Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Interactions and Energy. Students explore and learn Science concepts and process skills by participating actively in differentiated learning experiences at the five stages of IBL. The stages include Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate.

**Blended Learning**

Blended Learning is part of the curriculum to enrich students’ learning of Science. It enables students to make connections between classroom learning and real-life situations. It also provides them with more opportunities to learn in a self-directed manner, and collaboratively with others. The multiple modes of Blended Learning integrate face-to-face lessons, hands-on experimentation with Student Learning Space (SLS) and online tools such as web-based simulations, Google Classroom and Sites, and others to create a seamless and enriching learning experience for students in acquiring and applying scientific concepts in the world around them. 

  

**School-Based Assessments**

Students’ learning and achievement levels in Science are assessed using varied modes. Both formative and summative assessments are conducted in an on-going manner. These include performance-based assessment tasks, individual projects with self-assessment rubrics, and written assessments. Teachers provide holistic and effective feedback to individual students to help them reflect and take actions to improve their learning. 

## Nurturing Students' Interests and Talents

**Level Challenges**  
Level challenges involving real-life contexts and scientific concepts for selected topics are posed to students. The challenges provide the opportunity for students to be engaged in either individual or group problem-solving projects. They learn to be resourceful and resilient as they work on the products. Finally, they share and showcase their products to their peers to learn from one another.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science**

The programme is a 2-year Science enrichment programme for Primary 4 students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills among high-ability primary students in Science, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.

Students learn Science by going through the same process that scientists use to generate knowledge in Science. Through collaborative learning and guidance provided by the teacher, students practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions.

**Participation in External Competitions**

Students are introduced to various external Science competitions through school-based activities. Yearly, students who show interests and aptitude are mentored by teachers to participate in external competitions.

**Science Learning at Lower Primary**

To ignite students’ interest in Science, Science learning experiences are integrated into STELLAR English Language lessons at Primary 1 and 2. Inter-departmental Learning Journeys are also conducted to introduce Science knowledge and skills as part of their early experiences to the learning of Science.
