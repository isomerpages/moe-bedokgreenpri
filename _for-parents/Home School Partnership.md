The Ministry of Education (MOE) has released a set of guidelines on the development of positive school-home partnerships. The guidelines were officially announced by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal, on 16 February 2019, at a parent engagement event at Yu Neng Primary School.

  

In BGPS, we believe that a strong home-school partnership can facilitate more positive outcomes for the child. Parental involvement in learning at home, can help to deepen the childâ€™s school-based learning. A coherent home-school learning environment can help to reinforce the inculcation of values and the development of positive self-management and skills. At the same time, parents can gain greater confidence and satisfaction in parenting, thereby developing a stronger bond with the child. This home-school partnership is most effective when founded on mutual respect and trust.
