Our P1s are now one-month old BGPians! We are delighted to engage more than 160 of our P1 parents this evening during our P1 Parent Engagement Online Session over Zoom. Each class was hosted by their very own Form Teachers, who shared numerous photos of their students during their first month in school. Parents were also given updates about the school's emphasis on respect and greetings, attendance and punctuality, as well as curriculum expectations and learning outcomes for P1s. Do check out the photos of our P1 Form Teachers in action!

Please find the sharing conducted during the Primary One Introductory Briefing on 27 January 2022 in the document -
