The school works closely with our community groups, especially those around the school such as Bedok Community Centre. As a member of the community, BGPS values the support and learning opportunities provided by the community. Students get to contribute in community-related activities and experience the values, the people and the richness of our culture. Some of the community partners that we have worked with are:

*   Bedok Community Centre
*   South East Community Development Council
*   Neighbouring secondary or IP schools -Â Bedok View Secondary, Bedok Green Secondary, Temasek Secondary school, Temasek Junior College
