BGPS maintains strategic partnerships with a variety of external organisations to supplement the support for our diverse student population. This includes non-profit organisations, government and non-government organisations. The school also collaborates with both local and overseas educational institutions to provide cross-cultural exchanges and activities to enrich studentsâ€™ learning.
