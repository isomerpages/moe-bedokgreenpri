BGPS hope to instill in all students the value of self-discipline. Self-discipline is a life-long value that will serve and benefit them tremendously as they grow and mature. BGPS provide opportunities and support for students while being taught on how to accept responsibility for their own behaviour. 

  
BGPS believes that enforcing good discipline is part of the school's responsibility in providing a holistic education for its students and promoting a safe and caring school environment. Its success depends greatly on the understanding and co-operation it receives from the parents/guardians of the students.

#### Model Class Award

The Model Class Award (MCA) programme provides a holistic and comprehensive approach towards discipline at the class level.

MCA seeks to nurture disciplined and responsible BGPians who play their part to ensure a conducive, safe and health-promoting learning environment. MCA is presented to the class every month for displaying positive behaviour in accordance to a set of criteria.

The assessment criteria covers four main areas:

*   Positive behaviour in school
*   Positive behaviour in classroom
*   Classroom cleanliness after school
*   Canteen cleanliness

To attain the MCA, a class must score a minimum total of 24 points for the month.

The class is awarded a certificate of achievement. The certificate is displayed in class. The class, which attains the highest points in the level, will receive a pennant which will be hung outside the classroom proudly for a month. Classes that attain 3 certificates will also receive a reward to celebrate their synergy and success. 

The assessment period of MCA is from January to November and the scores for individual classes will be displayed on the MCA scoreboard located near the canteen. Raw scores will be given to FTs. They will present the data to the class and the Class Chairman/Vice-chairman will assist the FTs to review the class performance and work on areas of improvement during this period.

#### Students' Suggestion Scheme (SSS):

The Students’ Suggestion Scheme (SSS) is a platform created to give the students an opportunity for their ‘voice’ to be heard by their teachers and peers in helping to improve the school system or environment. It also provides a chance for students to share their ideas in improving the school via innovation and critical thinking. This would generate a greater sense of belonging to the school among students.

  

Based on Theme Based Approach, the Student Councilors will work with teachers-in-charge in coming up with a theme or area to work on. SSS is rolled out during FTGP periods and all students will have a chance to brainstorm for ideas or share their views.  There will be one suggestion per semester.
