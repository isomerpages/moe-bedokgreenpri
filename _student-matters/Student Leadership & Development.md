**Vision**: Every BGPian A Leader Who Leads to Serve and Make a Difference  
  
The school adopts a **3E** progressive approach in building leadership capacity in every student:  

*   **E**xpose - acquisition of core knowledge and skills through curriculum (CCE 2021, The Leader-in-Me)
*   **E**nrich - application of learning 
*   **E**xcel - demonstration of excellence

In doing so, we build a network of student leaders contributing to the leadership culture in BGPS:

**LEAD SELF**

_A responsible leader: "I lead myself"_

Students learn and live our school values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Compassion. They are recognised for their positive behaviours by the monthly STAR Awards.

**LEAD CLASS**

_A respected leader: "I lead my friends"_

**Class Committee, CCA Representatives**

Students formally appointed to serve their class or represent their CCA have diverse responsibilities that vary according to their roles, but all of them have the desire to be of service and to lead their peers in achieving common goals.

**LEAD SCHOOL**  

_An Exemplary Leader: "I lead others"_

**Student Councillors**

Student Councillors are acknowledged school-wide as good role models. Assigned to one of the five teams - Cyber-wellness, Green, Health & Safety, National Education, Peer Support - our Councillors demonstrate their leadership by upholding our school's values as they perform their duties with competence and care. 

  

**CCA Leaders**  

CCA Leaders demonstrate leadership in their expertise in skills required for their CCAs, and in their constant zeal to bring their CCA to greater heights.

**Student Council Executive Committee (EXCO)**  

BGPS Council EXCO comprises the President and two Vice-Presidents with Councillors (EXCO) and CCA (EXCO). As the pinnacle of BGPS Student Leadership, Council EXCO is committed to be leaders of leaders, building a sense of identity and pride within the school as advocates of student voice and organisers of leadership events.
